## What is a Knowledge Accumulation Log (KAL)?

A KAL record describes what activities you performed in a day to broaden your knowledge in a particular category (subject/field/specialization). It sounded cool, that's why I made it up! ðŸ˜›

---

Example list of committed KAL records for an imaginary person:

```
> kal ls --all 2024

# {year}-{ordinal_day} | {category}: {details}

2024-1 | Philosophy: Today, I committed myself to thinking about existence itself ðŸ§ 
...
2024-90 | Computer Graphics: Took a deep dive into render pipelines with Vulkan.
2024-91 | Scuba Diving: Joined to a local diving club this afternoon!
...
2024-193 | Cinematography: Practiced common composition techniques ðŸŽ¥
...
2024-294 | Deep Learning: Learned about autograd engines and the math behind.
...
```
